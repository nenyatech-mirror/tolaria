# Use The AI

Tolaria gives you two ways to ask for AI help: open the AI panel for an ongoing conversation, or prompt directly from the editor with `Cmd+K` followed by a space.

## Choose How To Prompt

- **AI panel** is best for longer conversations, agent work, and requests that need visible back-and-forth.
- **Inline prompt** is best when you are already writing. Press `Cmd+K`, type a space, then write the prompt you want the AI to handle from the current note context.

## Choose A Target

Open Settings and choose the default AI target:

- **Coding agent** for tool-backed vault editing through Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot, OpenCode, Pi, Antigravity CLI, Kiro, or Hermes Agent.
- **Local model** for Ollama or LM Studio chat over note context.
- **API model** for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, OpenRouter, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

If a coding agent is missing, install it and reopen Tolaria or switch to another target.

## Choose An Agent Model

Some coding agents expose a model picker in the AI workspace. Choose **Agent default** to let the CLI decide, or select one of the models reported by the installed agent.

Tolaria remembers the choice separately for each agent. If an agent removes a previously selected model, Tolaria falls back to **Agent default** instead of sending an obsolete model ID.

## Permission Mode

Coding agents support per-vault permission modes:

- **Vault Safe** keeps agents limited to file, search, and edit tools.
- **Power User** can allow shell commands for agents that support them.

Direct model targets always stay in chat mode. They can use note context, but they cannot edit vault files through tools.

## Good Requests

- "Find notes related to this project."
- "Summarize what changed in this note."
- "Draft a weekly review from these linked notes."
- "Update this checklist based on the current project status."

## Review Changes

AI edits are file edits. Review them with Tolaria's diff and Git history before committing.

Use the stop control when a request is no longer useful or an agent is taking the wrong direction. Stopping ends the active stream without changing the target for your next request.
